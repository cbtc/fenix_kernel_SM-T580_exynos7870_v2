# Lazer_Kernel J7 Prime

A Custom Kernel for Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime / J7 2016.
The main purpose of this Kernel is to have a stock-like Kernel that runs on G610x (J7 Prime) 
variants and J710x (J7 2016) variants. 

## How to use
- Adjust the toolchain path in build.sh and Makefile to match the path on your system. 
- Run build.sh and follow the prompts, alternatively you can use a command line:

-	./build.sh 0  will perform Clean Workspace
-	./build.sh 1  will perform Build LazerKernel boot.img for J7 Prime
-	./build.sh 2  will perform Build LazerKernel boot.img for J7 2016
-	./build.sh 3  will perform Build LazerKernel boot.img for J7 Prime + J7 2016
-	./build.sh 4  will perform Build LazerKernel boot.img and .zip for J7 Prime
-	./build.sh 5  will perform Build LazerKernel boot.img and .zip for J7 2016
-	./build.sh 6  will perform Build LazerKernel boot.img and .zip for J7 Prime + J7 2016(Seperate)
-	./build.sh 7  will perform Build LazerKernel boot.img and .zip for J7 Prime + J7 2016(All-In-One)

  IE:   ./build.sh 1

- When finished, the new .img or .zip file will be created in the build directory.
- If Java is installed, the .zip files will be automatically signed.
